# Password generator fully coded by ChatGPT
A password generator coded in python fully made by ChatGPT.
ChatGPT is a GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) chatbot.It is capable of
speaking and carrying on conversations, responding to inquiries, dispensing
knowledge, making suggestions, and even cracking jokes or

conversing informally. Based on its training data, it can comprehend and interpret
user inputs, produce suitable replies, and learn and modify itself over time to better
serve its users.

I used this technology and asked ChatGPT to create a python program that generated passwords
randomly and this is what it gave me.

ChatGPT only made the "Password Generator.exe" I did the icon and the requirements file.

(I did not edit this code, only chatGPT coded this.)

# How to use
1 - Make sur you have python and pip installed on your machine.

2 - Run the "Requirements.bat" file and wait until all the needed libraries are downloaded.

3 - Now all you have to do is run the "Password generator.exe" file and enjoy !
